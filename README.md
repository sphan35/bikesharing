## Summary
- From our results and the many data visualizations provided, a representation of the impact Citibike has had in New York City is a much needed sample size for future ventures of Citibike in cities such as Des Moines. The data collected and analyzed came from the month of August in New York City, and this showcased a unique insight into the busiest hours of Citibike usage and the top starting locations for the Citibike stations. From those two data points alone, the audience and investors can see that Citibike was heavilty used in the afternoon from 2PM to 7Pm and even maintained a steady flow of usage during the morning hours of 8AM to 12PM as people commuted for work or early morning activiies. Additionally, top starting stations based on bubble indications allowed for a visualization of potential or ideal spots for Citibike stations to be placed. Based on the "Top Starting Locatons", the urban-city seemed more likely to have more users of the service rather than the suburbs. The discrete line graphs provided valuable information of the demographics using Citibike. The data visualizations that provided what day of week, hour of day, and how long riders used the Citibike service is important data facts that determine the popularity and viability of Citibike as a service.
